Inheritance is the process by which genetic information is passed on from parent to child.

<v-after>

**In Programming**: Inheritance is the process by which features are passed on from parent to child.

- JavaScript is not class-based language
- It's an **object-oriented** language

# Objects are first-class citizen

```ts {1-3|1-6|1-3,8-9}
const greeting = {
  message: "Welcome to freeCodeCamp!"
};

// accessing properties
greeting.message; // Welcome to freeCodeCamp!

// where does this comes from?
greeting.toString(); 
```

- Every object has a special property called **[[Prototype]]**.
- This property is a **link** to an object.
- Since **[[Prototype]]** is object, it also has it's own **[[Prototype]]**
</v-clicks>

<!--
it's called prototype chain.

# Demo

<!-- const obj = {}; -->

layout: center
---
# How's this chain constructed?
---
layout: center
---
# Object literal

```ts
const obj = {};
```

---
layout: center
---

# Object Constructor

```ts
const obj = new Object();
```
---
layout: center
---

# `Object.create` method

```ts {1|3-6|8-9|all}
Object.create(prototype); // returns object with given prototype

// prototype object
let SmartPhone = {
  captureImages: function() {}
};

let iPhone = Object.create(SmartPhone);
iPhone.captureImages(); // works
```

# Constructor method

```ts
function Rectangle(height, width) {
  this.height = height;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.calcArea = function() {
  return this.height * this.width;
}

const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
```

<v-click>

üß† Why use **prototype**?

# ES6 `class` keyword

```ts
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  calcArea() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
}

const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
```

# Using `extends`

```ts
class Parent {
  scold() {}
}

class Child extends Parent {
  haveFun() {}
}

const child = new Child();
```

# What happens when we access a property?

<!-- Show that in devtools -->
---

# How to access the `[[Prototype]]`

```ts
const obj = {};

// standard
Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);

// non-standard
obj.__proto__;
```

---

# How to check if property is inherited?

```ts
const object1 = {"property1": 42};

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('property1'));
// Expected output: true

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('toString'));
// Expected output: false
```
